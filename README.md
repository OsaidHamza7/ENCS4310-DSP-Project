## Usage
This application allows users to encode and decode English strings using voice frequencies. Follow the steps below to use the application:

### To Encode:
1. Open the encoder GUI.
2. Enter the string you wish to encode.
3. The application will convert the string into a voice-frequency signal.

### To Decode:
1. Open the decoder GUI.
2. Upload the .wav file with the encoded signal.
3. The application will decode the signal back into the original text string.

## Phase One: Encoder
The encoder represents each English character by a combination of three voice-band frequency components. This phase involves building a GUI that encodes any English string into a corresponding signal.

### Features:
- GUI for easy interaction.
- Encode strings into voice-frequency signals.
- Play or save the signal as a .wav file.

## Phase Two: Decoder
The decoder recovers text strings from encoded multi-frequency signals using frequency analysis and bandpass filters.

### Features:
- GUI for uploading and decoding audio files.
- Two decoding approaches: frequency analysis and bandpass filters.
- Display the decoded text string.

## Testing
The system was thoroughly tested to ensure accurate encoding and decoding.
